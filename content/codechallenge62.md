Hey Pythonistas,

This month we are holding a special challenge in collaboration with Python Alicante. Spin up your favorite editor and start coding in Python!

## The Challenge

We'd like to keep to a PyCon theme so let's find out how many female speakers have been at PyCon ES and what the trend is:

- Scrape 5 year's worth of Pycon ES sites, years 2013-2018, and for each year extract all of the speakers. They are usually located under "schedule", "agenda" or "charlas".

- Once you have a list of all of the speakers per year, use a Python lib or API of choice to determine if the speaker is female or not.

- Bonus 1: How does this data compare to Pycon US and/or EU?

- Bonus 2: Plot the data with your favorite data viz library - did the % of female speakers at Pycon ES go up or down in the past years? How does it compare to the Pycon US/EU findings in Bonus 1?

- PR your work [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/) no later than .. of July midnight AoE.

- The Pybites / Python Alicante jury will only look at solutions from Ninjas that PR their work and include code for both bonus items. Submission speed and elegance will be looked at in particular. Winners will receive one of 3 prizes at random: 

	- A free copy of the first [PyBites / Talk Python 100 days of Python course](https://talkpython.fm/100days?utm_source=pybites).
	- 6 months free access to our [200 Bites of Py exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/).
	- Spend US$50 on [one or more Python books of their choice](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=python&i=stripbooks-intl-ship&ref=nb_sb_noss_2).

We encourage you to join our [PyBites Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU) and hop in the #pyday channel to collaborate. Please do not post solutions in this channel. 

Last but not least: the intent is not to just focus on the _best_ solution. Rather, the priority for all should be to learn and improve your Python skills. Keep it cool like Fonzie and enjoy the ride!

Ideas for future challenges, channel ideas / requests can be submitted via [GH Issues](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

## Get serious, take your Python to the next level ...

At PyBites we're all about creating Python ninjas through challenges and real-world exercises. Read more about [our story](https://pybit.es/special-learning-python.html).

We are happy and proud to share that we now hear monthly stories from our users that they're landing new Python jobs. For many this is a dream come true, especially as they're often landing roles with significantly higher salaries!

Our _[200 Bites of Py exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)_ are geared toward instilling the habit of coding frequently, if not daily which will dramatically improve your Python and problem solving skills. This is __THE__ number one skillset necessary to becoming a linchpin in the industry and will enable you to crush it wherever codes need to be written.
