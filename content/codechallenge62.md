Hey Pythonistas,

This month we are holding a special challenge in collaboration with Python Alicante. Spin up your favorite editor and start coding in Python!

## The challenge

We'd like to use the Pycon theme so let's see how many female speakers there have been at Pycon ES and what the trend is:

- Scrape 5 year's worth of Pycon ES sites, years 2013-2018, and for each year extract all the speakers. They are usually located under "schedule", "agenda" or "charlas".

- Once you have a list of all the speakers per year, use a Python lib or API of choice to determine if the speaker is female or not.

- Bonus 1. How does this data compare to Pycon US and/or EU?

- Bonus 2. Plot the data with your favorite data viz library - did the % of female speakers at Pycon ES go up or down in the past years? And how does it compare to Pycon US/EU (as per 1.)?

- PR your work [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/), no later than .. of July midnight AoE.

- For the ninjas that that PR their work including code for both bonus items, the PyBites / Python Alicante jury will look at submission speed and elegance of the solution. Winners get one of 3 prizes: 

	- Free copy of the [first PyBites / Talk Python 100 days of Python course](https://talkpython.fm/100days?utm_source=pybites)
	- 6 months free access to our [200 Bites of Py exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)
	- Spend 50 buckaroos on [one or more Python books of choice](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=python&i=stripbooks-intl-ship&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)

We encourage you to join [our PyBites Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU) and hop on the #pyday channel to collaborate, just don't post solutions there, ok? 

Last but not least: there is no _best_ solution, only learning more and better Python. Keep it cool like Fonzie and enjoy the ride!

## Get serious, take your Python to the next level ...

At PyBites we're all about creating Python ninjas through challenge and real-world exercising ([our story](https://pybit.es/special-learning-python.html)).

We are happy and proud to share that we get monthly stories now from our users landing new Python jobs, not only something they dreamed about, also often leading to significant more cash in their pockets!

Our _[200 Bites of Py exercises](https://codechalleng.es/bites/)_ are geared towards instilling the coding habit, dramatically improving your Python and problem solving skills. This is THE number one skillset you will need to become a linchpin in the industry and will enable you to crunch it wherever codes need to be written.
